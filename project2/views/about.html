                    Hi! My name is Faris Karkelja, a 20-year-old salsa dancer based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
                    In 2021, I had the opportunity to showcase my talent on the mesmerizing platform of the 
                    Supertalent Show held in Zagreb, the capital city of Croatia.<br><br>
                    This experience was a crucial moment in my dance career, igniting a renewed sense of motivation 
                    that has fueled my continuous growth and improvement ever since.<br><br>
                <span class="read-more-text">   
                    Apart from my passion for the art of dance, I 
                    have a deep interest in various technological domains. Alongside my dance journey, I am 
                    currently engaged in higher education, focusing on Information Technology at the university level.
